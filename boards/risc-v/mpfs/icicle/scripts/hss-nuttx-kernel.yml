# HSS Payload Generator

# First, we can optionally set a name for our image, otherwise one will be created dynamically
set-name: 'PolarFire-SoC-HSS::nuttxbsp_kernel_payload'

# Next, we'll define the entry point addresses for each hart, as follows:
hart-entry-points: {u54_1: '0x80000000', u54_2: '0x80000000', u54_3: '0x80000000', u54_4: '0x80000000'}

#
payloads:
 nuttxbsp.bin: {exec-addr: '0x80000000', owner-hart: u54_1, priv-mode: prv_s, skip-opensbi: true}
